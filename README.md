# once the user is signed up, they can now login on the landing page and will be redirected to the questions page where the user can add questions and the user will still have to list 2 skills in order for the   uestion to be added
# on the questions page - a button has been added so the user can add more skills if needed and even added a "log out" button which will redirect the user to the landing page :)
